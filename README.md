**PolyLingua: A Multilingual Intelligent Speech Assistant**

---

## 🧠 **Objective**  
To develop an intelligent audio-based assistant capable of:
- Converting speech to text (STT)
- Translating non-English input to English or responding in the native language
- Converting text to speech (TTS)
- Detecting spoken language automatically (Language ID)
- Enabling fluid two-way conversation across multiple languages

---

## ⚙️ **Core Features**

### 🔉 1. **Speech-to-Text (STT)**  
- Converts real-time audio into text.
- Supports multiple languages using Whisper, DeepSpeech, or Google Speech API.

### 🗣️ 2. **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**  
- Detects when someone is speaking.
- Converts spoken language into structured text.

### 🧾 3. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**  
- Converts the assistant's textual response into natural-sounding speech.
- Use models like Tortoise TTS, Coqui TTS, or Google TTS.

### 🌍 4. **Language Detection & Translation**  
- Automatically detect the input language using libraries like `langdetect`, `fastText`, or HuggingFace models.
- If the input language is not English, translate it to English for processing.
- Translate responses back to the user's language if needed using `Google Translate`, `MarianMT`, or `M2M100`.

### 💬 5. **Conversational Agent**  
- A basic chatbot interface using LLMs like **Open Source Mistral**, **ChatGLM**, or **Gemma**.
- The bot can respond contextually and intelligently.

## 🌟 **Additional Advanced Features (Optional)**

### 🧑‍💻 6. **Speaker Identification**  
- Recognize who is speaking (if multiple users are involved).

### 🔎 7. **Emotion Recognition from Speech**  
- Identify speaker emotions using pitch, tone, and audio signals.


### 🔁 8. **Real-time Subtitling for Videos**  
- Generate live captions for videos in native language and/or translated.

### 🛜 9. **Offline Mode**  
- Use lightweight ASR/TTS/translation models that can run locally without internet.
